## Welcome to the new home of the Delphi Encryption Compendium (DEC) ##

The DEC is a cryptographic library for Delphi & C++ Builder.

Initially developed by **Hagen Reddmann** with major releases between 1999 and 2006 it is now maintained by [Arvid Winkelsdorf](http://code.google.com/u/winkelsdorf/) (digivendo GmbH).
